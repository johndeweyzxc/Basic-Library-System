Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire_A generation grew up on Rowling’s all-conquering magical fantasies, but countless adults have also been enthralled by her immersive world.

The Triwizard Tournament provides pace and tension, and Rowling makes her boy wizard look death in the eye for the first time.
A Little Life_This operatically harrowing American gay melodrama became an unlikely bestseller, and one of the most divisive novels of the century so far.

To Kill a Mockingbird_Lee’s To Kill a Mockingbird was published in 1960 and became an immediate classic of literature. The novel examines racism in the American South through the innocent wide eyes of a clever young girl named Jean Louise (“Scout”) Finch.
